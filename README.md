## How to use
### Zipping
First you open the main.py file and select number 1 (zip).  
After that it will ask you for the location of the directory that you want to zip.  
Now you just wait and after some time it will be done. Now you can just open the out.zipt file and rename it to any name you want.  

This file can be unzipped with number 2 (unpacking) info on it <a href=https://github.com/J3ldo/Folder-Zipper/blob/main/README.md#unzipping>here</a>.

### Unzipping
First you open the main.py file and select number 2 (unpack).  
After that it will ask you for the name/location of your zipped file. The name of your file will be <file name>.zipt  
If you've unzipped a file with the same name before it will ask you to override it you can press y to override it and n to set a custom name for the dump folder.  

Finally after waiting a bit your file is unzipped.
